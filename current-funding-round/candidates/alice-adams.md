## **Preferred areas of contribution**

* [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) - Intending to solely work on features \[A], \[B] and \[C] over the coming months. Projects \[D], \[E], \[F] and \[G] are waiting for one or all of these feature releases for their own projects. If more important features come up during my contribution period I would focus on those features instead if needed.
* [web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) - If I have any remaining time in between these feature releases I will help with more documentation updates and general improvements. If there are no changes needed then I will help with other areas in the ecosystem as suggested by the community, contributors and founding entities.

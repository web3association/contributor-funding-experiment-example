  * [github.com/gmx-io/gmx-contracts](https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-contracts) - Minor contributions to contracts but mainly have been using these whilst developing the frontend.



## Ecosystem involvement

Have been historically involved with the Avalanche ecosystem so I have already been actively involved in the EVM development environment. Not attended any ETH events, discussions or workshops any time recently.



## **Preferred areas of contribution**

Looking to contribute towards community suggested ideas. Some potential focus areas could include:

* Wallets integrations - I have a lot of experience with the EVM already and have working on a number of wallet integrations within the AVAX ecosystem. Particularly familiar with MetaMask, WalletConnect and Browser Wallet.
* [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://scaffoldeth.io/) - I've worked with Scaffold ETH for a number of my own side projects and in hackathons so could be suitable for supporting a range of new projects that are experimenting with new ideas.

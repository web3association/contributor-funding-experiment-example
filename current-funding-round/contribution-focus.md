# Contribution board

The contribution board is used by the contributors to record and showcase the contribution efforts they are working at any given point in time. Contributors will create and manage tasks that they are working on. Tasks will start in a backlog and move into "In progress" and then into the "In review" and "Done" columns once they are completed.

Use the [community guide ](../contributor-funding-guides/community-guide.md)to learn about providing feedback or suggestions to any contribution tasks listed on the board.&#x20;

The contribution board can be found here:

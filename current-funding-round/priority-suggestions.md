# Priority suggestions

The priority suggestions board is the place where anyone in the community can suggest a priority for the contributors to consider. Community members can upvote the priority suggestions they believe are the most important. Contributors will then take these suggestions into account when they are deciding where they should direct their contribution efforts.

Use the [community guide](../contributor-funding-experiment/community-guide.md) to learn about making priority suggestions.&#x20;

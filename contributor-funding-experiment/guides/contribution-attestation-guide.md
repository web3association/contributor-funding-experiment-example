# Contribution attestation guide

Some contribution efforts are not easy to digitally verify. Contribution attestations enable someone to vouch for another persons contribution efforts. These attestations can help to provide more evidence that a contributor has actually made the contributions they say they have.



**Contribution attestation process**

1. Review the contribution efforts listed in the contribution log. Determine which ones you are able to vouch for based on your own observations and involvement in those contribution efforts.
2. Fill in the contribution attestation template information and post the attestation as a comment in the pull request. You can find the contribution log attestation template here - \[LINK]

# Contributor guide

Contributors have the simple goal of generating as much impact as possible during their funded contribution period. Contributors will focus their efforts towards new or existing open source development projects that could generate impact for the ecosystem.



**Expectations & responsibilities**

* **Self accountability** - Contributors have the autonomy to decide how they use their own time and where they focus their contribution efforts. Contributors should take into account any suggestions and feedback provided by the community and founding entities when deciding how to best allocate their time.
* **Open source** - Contributors can only work on open source initiatives as these solutions can then be used by the entire community.
* **Collaboration** - Contributors are expected to collaborate with others in the community and identify shared problems that might need resolving. Effective collaboration can help with reducing the amount of duplicated efforts and outcomes.



**Contributor proposal process**

To be considered as a contributor candidate:

1. Fork the funding process GitHub locally from - \[LINK]
2. Copy the contributor proposal template located in ‘/fund1/candidates/contributor-proposal.md’
3. Fill in your personal and professional information
4. Submit your contributor proposal as a pull request
5. Answer questions and consider any amendments that should be made to the proposal after any feedback has be received



**Contributor onboarding**

If you get selected as a funded contributor:

1. Review the ideas that have been suggested by the founding entities and community - \[LINK]
2. Indicate your preferences by commenting on the ideas you believe are the most important to work on
3. Join the internal contributor chat to coordinate and collaborate with other contributors and the founding entities - \[LINK]
4. Join the contribution log chat to share your monthly contribution log pull requests so they can be verified and approved - \[LINK]
5. Join the open contributor chat to coordinate and collaborate with the community - \[LINK]



**Monthly contribution process**

Contributors will repeat these steps each month until their funded term length is completed.

1. Complete a months worth of contribution effort. Contribution board tasks should be updated when a task moves from any of the different execution stages such as from in progress to completed.
2. When you are close to finishing a contribution task you should share your next intended contribution task by moving it in the contribution board. Share the task in the internal chat to enable others to check that their own contributions won’t overlap with this work or duplicate any of the outcomes.
3. At the end of the month, document any of your contribution outputs and efforts in a contribution log. A contribution log template \[LINK] is available as a reference as well as a number of contribution log examples \[LINK].
4. Make a pull request with your contribution log.
5. Request other contributors or community members to provide any attestations about the contribution efforts that are not easy for others to verify.
6. Share the contribution log pull request in the contribution log chat for the funding operator to review.
7. Consider any amendments to the contribution log that are suggested by the fund operator.
8. The contribution log will then be approved if the minimum contribution expectations are met. For this experiment, if there are any issues with the contribution log it will be reviewed by the founding entities to make any final decision. If approved the contributor will be eligible for future payment and can start their next month of contribution.

# Contributor guide

Contributors have the simple goal of generating as much impact as possible during their funded contribution period. Contributors should focus their efforts towards any open source development project that could generate impact for the ecosystem.



**Expectations & responsibilities**

* **Self accountability** - Contributors have the autonomy to decide how they use their own time and where they focus their contribution efforts. Contributors should take into account any suggestions and feedback provided by the community and founding entities when deciding how to best allocate their time.
* **Open source contributions** - Contributors can only work on open source initiatives as these solutions can then be used by the entire community.
* **Collaborative** - Contributors are expected to collaborate with others in the community and identify shared problems that are worth resolving. Effective collaboration should help with reducing the amount of duplicated efforts across the ecosystem.



**Contributor proposal process**

To submit your contributor proposal:

1. Fork the [GitHub project](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding-experiment-example) locally.
2. Copy the [contributor proposal template](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding/blob/main/contributor-funding-experiment/templates/forms/contributor-proposal.md) or copy an [example contributor proposal](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding-experiment-example/tree/main/current-funding-round/candidates) and create a file in the candidates folder.
3. Update the proposal template with your own personal and professional information.
4. Submit your contributor proposal as a pull request with the title of "Contributor proposal - \[Your full name]". Use this [example proposal pull request](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding-experiment-example/pull/1) as a reference.
5. Share your proposal pull request to the community and the fund operator.&#x20;
6. Answer any questions and resolve any issues that get identified. Consider any amendments you want to make before the proposal is approved and merged. Once the proposal is merged you will be included in the contributor selection decision.



**Contributor onboarding**

If you are selected as a funded contributor you will need to follow these onboarding steps:

1. Review the contribution board ideas that have been suggested by the founding entities and community.
2. Indicate your preferences by commenting on the ideas you believe are the most important to work on.
3. Join the internal contributor chat to coordinate and collaborate with other contributors and the founding entities. Ask the fund operator for a link to join.
4. Join the open contributor contribution log chat to share your monthly contribution log pull requests so they can be verified and approved.  Ask the fund operator for a link to join.
5. Join the [open contributor chat](https://t.me/contributorfundingexample) to coordinate and collaborate with the community.



**Monthly contribution process**

Contributors will repeat these steps each month until their funded term length is completed.

1. Complete a months worth of contribution effort. Contribution board tasks should be updated when a task moves from any of the different execution stages such as from in progress to completed.
2. When you are close to finishing a contribution task you should share your next intended contribution task by moving it in the contribution board. Share the task in the internal chat to enable others to check that their own contributions wonâ€™t overlap with this work or duplicate any of the outcomes.
3. At the end of the month, document any of your contribution outputs and efforts in a contribution log. A [contribution log template](https://funding.contributors.org/contributor-funding-experiment/templates/documents/contribution-log-form) is available as a guide. There is also an [example contribution log](https://example.contributors.org/current-funding-round/funded-contributors/alice-adams/june-2024) available as well as a pending [pull request example](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding-experiment-example/pull/2). You can also review more contribution log examples in the [Web3 Association contributors](https://docs.web3association.co/contributors) documentation.
4. Submit your contribution log as a pull request with the title of "Contribution log - \[Your full name], \[Month Year]". Use this [example contribution log pull request](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding-experiment-example/pull/2) as a reference.
5. Make requests to other contributors or community members to provide any attestations about any of the contribution efforts that are not as easy for others to verify.
6. Share the contribution log pull request in the contribution log chat for the funding operator to review.
7. Consider any amendments to the contribution log that are suggested by the fund operator.
8. The contribution log will then be approved if the minimum contribution expectations are met. For this experiment, if there are any issues with the contribution log it will be reviewed by the founding entities to make any final decision. If approved the contributor will be eligible for future payment and can start their next month of contribution.

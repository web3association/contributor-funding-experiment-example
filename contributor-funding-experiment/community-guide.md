# Community guide

The community includes everyone in the ecosystem. This means the guide is for the founding entities, contributors, voters and any other community members.



**Priority suggestions**

Anyone in the community can suggest new priorities for the contributors to consider when deciding where to direct their contribution efforts. Community members are also encouraged to upvote the most important suggestions so that contributors are aware of the priorities that the community believes are the most important.

1. Go to the [priority suggestions board](https://web3association.canny.io/contributor-funding-example).
2. Create a priority with a title and description.&#x20;
3. At the bottom of the description add a "Source:" heading and then list out any links that provide evidence about the relevance and importance of the suggested priority.
4. Share your suggested priority to other community members so they can review and upvote your suggestion if they agree that its important.



**Contributor proposal feedback**

After the contributor proposals have been submitted the voters and wider community will be invited to provide any feedback and suggestions they have about the proposals. Contributors will then consider these suggestions and feedback provided before making any final changes to their proposal.

1. Go to the funding [project pull requests page](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding-experiment-example/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+)
2. If necessary, filter the pull requests by typing in "Contributor proposal" into the filter search bar.
3. Review the pending contributor proposals by clicking on a proposal pull request and reviewing the "Filed changed" tab.
4. If you have any suggestions or feedback for the proposal you can leave them on the "Conversation" tab as a comment



**Contribution board feedback**

The community can see what the contributors are working on at any given point in time. Community members might have feedback, advice or suggestions that they want to share to a task that is recorded on the contribution board. To provide contribution feedback:

1. Go to the [contributor funding contribution board](https://github.com/orgs/web3association/projects/1).
2. Review the tasks listed across the board and identify any tasks that you want to comment on.
3. Share a message in the [open contributor chat ](https://t.me/contributorfundingexample)that links to the task and then provide any feedback you have in the same message.
4. The relevant contributor will respond to the message when they are able to do so. Check for a response over the next few days.

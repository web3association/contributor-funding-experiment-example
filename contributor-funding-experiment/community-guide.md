# Community guide

The community includes everyone in the ecosystem. This means the guide is for the founding entities, contributors, voters and any other community members.



**Priority suggestions**

1. Go to the community suggestions board.





**Contributor proposal feedback**

After the contributor proposals have been submitted the voters and wider community will be invited to provide any feedback and suggestions they have about the proposals. Contributors can then consider the suggestions and feedback provided before making any final changes to their proposal. Suggestions and feedback will be provided as comments on the proposal pull request.

# Contribution attestation guide

Some contribution efforts are not as easy to digitally verify. Contribution attestations are a way for people to vouch for another contributors contribution efforts. These attestations help to provide some evidence that a contributor has actually made the contributions they say they have.



**Contribution attestation process**

1. **Review contribution efforts** - Review the contribution efforts listed in the contributors contribution log. Determine which contribution efforts you are able to vouch for based on your own observations and involvement in those contribution efforts.
2. **Create contribution attestation** - Fill in the contribution attestation template information and post the attestation as a comment in the pull request. A [contribution attestation template](https://funding.contributors.org/contributor-funding-experiment/templates/documents/contribution-attestation-form) is available for reference as well as an [example contribution attestation](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding-experiment-example/pull/2#issuecomment-2253817574) on a contribution log pull request.

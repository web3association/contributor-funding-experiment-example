# Community guide

The community includes everyone in the ecosystem. This means the guide is for the founding entities, contributors, voters and any other community members.



**Priority suggestions**

:date: _Start date: 12:00pm 01/06/24, End date: No end date._

Anyone in the community can suggest new priorities that the contributors will consider when deciding where they direct their contribution efforts. Community members are also encouraged to upvote the most important suggestions so that contributors are aware of the priorities that the community believes are the most important.

1. **Review priority suggestions** - Go to the [priority suggestions board](https://web3association.canny.io/priority-suggestions-example) and review any existing priority suggestions.
2. **Submit priority suggestions** - If a priority suggestion doesn't exist that you believe is important you can create one with a title and description. At the bottom of the description add a "Source:" heading and then list out any links that provide evidence about the relevance and importance of the suggested priority. Share any priority suggestions you created with other community members for them to review.
3. **Respond to existing priority suggestions** - Provide any feedback you have to any existing priority suggestions. Upvote the suggestions that you believe are the most important for the ecosystem to focus on.



**Contributor proposal feedback**

:date: _Start date: 12:00pm 01/07/24, End date: 12:00pm 08/07/24_

After the contributor proposals have been submitted the voters and wider community will be invited to provide any feedback and suggestions they have about the proposals. Contributors will then consider these suggestions and feedback provided before making any final changes to their proposal.

1. **Review contributor proposals** - Go to the [funding projects pull request page](https://github.com/web3association/contributor-funding-experiment-example/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+). If there are many pull requests you can filter the pull requests by typing in "Contributor proposal" into the filter search bar. Review the pending contributor proposals by clicking on a proposal pull request and reviewing the "Files changed" tab.
2. **Provide contributor proposal feedback** - If you have any suggestions or feedback for a proposal you can leave a comment on the "Conversation" tab.



**Contribution board feedback**

:date: _Start date: 12:00pm 01/08/24, End date: 12:00pm 01/02/25_

The community can see what the contributors are working on at any given point in time. Community members might have feedback, advice or suggestions that they want to share to a task that is recorded on the contribution board. To provide contribution feedback:

1. **Review contribution board tasks** - Go to the [contributor funding contribution board](https://github.com/orgs/web3association/projects/1). Review the tasks listed across the board and identify any tasks that you want to comment on.
2. **Share contribution task feedback** - Share a message in the [open contributor chat ](https://t.me/contributorfundingexample) that links to the task and then provide any feedback you have in the same message. The relevant contributor will respond to the message when they are able to do so. Check for a response later in that day or the following day.
